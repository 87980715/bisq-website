<h2>Features and Philosophy</h2>

<p>Unlike traditional online exchanges, Bisq is designed to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instantly accessible</span> &#8211; no need for registration or approval from a central authority.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decentralized</span> &#8211; there is no single point of failure. The system is peer-to-peer and trading can not be stopped or censored.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Safe</span> &#8211; Bisq never holds your funds. Decentralized arbitration system and security deposits protect traders.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Private</span> &#8211; no one except trading partners exchange personally identifying data. All personal data is stored locally.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secure</span> &#8211; end-to-end encrypted communication routed over Tor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open</span> &#8211; every aspect of the project is transparent. The code is <a href="https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare" target="_blank">open source</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Easy</span> &#8211; we take usability seriously.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bisq is for those who do not want to forfeit control or privacy to a central authority in order to trade with other individuals. We regard financial transactions as a form of private speech that should be protected from surveillance by banks, governments, and other institutions.</p>
