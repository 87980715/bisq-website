<h1>Community</h1>

<p>Bisq started in early 2014 as a proof of concept prototype by <a href="https://plus.google.com/106046176723553419722/posts">Manfred Karrer</a>. Since July 2014 the community around Bisq has steadily been growing. The community is helping to distribute the work load, speed up application development and take care of non-core tasks like building this website.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>Bisq is not a company and not operating customer care or support. Same as in Bitcoin itself there are no hotlines to call if you have problems. But there is a community which will help if you need support. Just get in touch over any of the above channels or contact the Bisq team.</p>

<p>If anything goes wrong in the application during a trade (due a bug or network issues) the software will display a &#8220;Open support ticket&#8221; button if the problem is recognized by the software. With that you get in contact with the arbitrator who will investigate the issue.</p>

<p>If a trade exceeds the allowed trade period (8 days for bank transfers, 1 day for most others) you get displayed a &#8220;Open dispute&#8221; button. Here you can contact the arbitrator who will resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>Bisq team</h2>

<p>The <a href="/team">Bisq Team</a> is made up of a decentralized group of skilled volunteers from around the world.</p>
