<h1>DAO</h1>
<p>Decentralized autonomous organization</p>
<p>Very contrary to the infamous ICO models where people ask for a lot of money for whitepaper-ware we have a working platform developed by altruistic contributions and donations which is out since more than a year and we will distribute the ownership and management to those who have contributed to the project - those who helped to make a decentralized exchange reality!</p>


<p>The paper about the Bisq DAO:<br/>

<p>As soon the DAO has launched the DAO tokens (BSQ) can be traded like any other crypto currency in Bisq.</p>
<p>We distribute the tokens to many contributors who have supported us.</p>
