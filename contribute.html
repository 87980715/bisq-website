  <a href="/team/">entirely by volunteers</a>. In the spirit of Open Source we have opted to create Bisq without the demands or influence of investors.
</p>
<p>Each of us is involved in the project because we personally believe in it! This is not just another Bitcoin Startup, this is a project aiming to be driven by the community and serving the community.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can help support Bisq&#8217;s development:</p>
<h2>Contribute your skills</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this then you have probably got skills that would really help Bisq build and grow. We are constantly looking for skilled volunteers who can help us with the development of Bisq and spread the word to the wider Bitcoin community.</p>
<div class="isa_success"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong><br/>
  We are currently seeking experienced Java developers. If you have experience with Java please join the
  <a href="/community/#mailing-list">Mailing List</a> and let us know!
</div>
<p>In the mean time there are other ways you can help. Take a read of the list below:</p>
<ul class="extraspace">
  <li><strong>Volunteer as a Java developer</strong><br/>
    Bisq is written in Java and we require more developers to speed up development and bring the software to a 1.0 release as soon as possible. Bisq is project managed and tracked using Github. To see the code and become involved as a developer please visit us on Github:<br/>
    <a href="https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/">• Bisq on Github</a></li>
  <li><strong>Share Bisq on social media</strong><br/>
    Do you have connections on Social Media who are interested in Bitcoin? Help us by sharing our website on Google+, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, Pinterest or any other of your favorite networks. Every share counts!
  </li>
  <li><strong>Become a tester</strong><br/>
    Bisq needs the help of dedicated and reliable testers to help us catch any bugs early. Regardless of your operating system or experience level if you have time to test the application and write up the bugs that you notice we want your help! To put your name down as a tester please visit Github:<br/>
    <a href="https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/issues/173">• Application Testing of Bisq on Github</a></li>
  <li><strong>Write a translation</strong><br/>
    Bisq is going to be available everywhere where Bitcoin is used &#8211; so worldwide! To make this project accessible to everyone we will need lots of help translating the User Interface into other languages. Please visit Github and put your name down for a language if you can help with translating Bisq:<br/>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Contribute to a bounty</h2>
<p>We have set up several bounties for development tasks. You can either support an existing bounty by donating to the bounty address or set up your own bounty for a feature you would love to see to get implemented in Bisq.</p>
<p>Please check out our
  <a href="https://forum.bitsquare.io/t/bitsquare-bounties-rule-set-and-overview/220">forum webpage</a> or

<p>By donating bitcoin to our donation wallet you will be helping Bisq pay for our
  <a href="/finances/">direct costs</a> like web hosting, domain names, SSL certificates, a Vimeo account and so on. So if you support this project and are in a position to help us out then that would be wonderful.
</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>Note:</strong> Donations to Bisq are not tax deductable as we are not formally registered in the jurisdiction of any Government. We do not accept donations in Altcoins at this point in time. We would be really grateful if you converted them to Bitcoin and donated them that way though!</em>
