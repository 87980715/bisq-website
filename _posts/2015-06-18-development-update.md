<p>It was a bit quiet here the last months, but there was going on a lot on the development front.</p>
<p>I have implemented the support for various
  <strong>payment methods</strong> (OKPay, SEPA, AliPay, Swish,&#8230;) and the
  <strong>arbitration system</strong>.<br/>
  We also have now
  <strong>Altcoins support!</strong> So you can change safely and in a decentralized way your Altcoin against Bitcoin.
</p>
<p>The arbitration system comes with a complete messaging/chat system so it is integrated to the process in a way that it makes the life for arbitrators and traders as easy as possible in case of a dispute.<br/>
  I just published a
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/131086362">video</a> of the current application showing all those new features.</p>
<p>Stay tuned we are getting closer to the release!</p>
