  <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-275" src="/images/new-bitsquare-website-300x217.png" alt="new-bitsquare-website" width="300" height="217"/>As the Bisq Application comes closer to a public Alpha we have been working hard towards updating the Bisq website too. The new website went live as of October 26, 2014.
</p>
<p>One of the areas where Bisq needs help is in attracting additional Java developers to help with application development. We hope that the new website makes the project much easier to understand and will encourage people to become involved in the community.</p>
<p>If you are interested in helping to build Bisq then please check out the
  <a href="/community/">Community page</a> and become involved! Even if you&#8217;re not able to devote much time to Bisq, it would mean the world to us if you would share our updated website on Social Media and Email with your friends and family who might be interested.
