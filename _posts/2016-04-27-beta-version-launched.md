<p>A big day for Bitsquare &#8211; we have launched our
  <a href="https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/releases/tag/v0.4.4">Beta version</a>!</p>
<p>After 3 months of extensive testing on the Bitcoin mainnet, The Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange is now ripe for a wider audience.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everybody who helped testing, providing liquidity, giving feedback or spreading the word. We extended our community channels with a new
  <a href="https://forum.bitsquare.io/">Forum</a>, a <a href="https://bisq-slack.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a>
  <a href="https://bitsquare.slack.com/">channel</a> and <a href="/community/">more</a>.</p>
<p>After the today&#8217;s Beta presentation in
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-barcelona/events/230228028/">Fab Lab Barcelona</a>, I will do a
  <a href="/press/#upcoming">tour through 15 European cities</a> to get in touch with the local community.</p>
<p>Hope to see you on the network!</p>
