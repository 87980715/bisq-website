        <description><![CDATA[When buying why do I need to have trading account with the same payment method as the seller if I can just deposit cash or make a wire transfer to the sellers account? For example: If I have the IBAM of the seller I can send to it via a wire transfer from anywhere in Europe. Its obvious that we need to setup a trading account to receive FIAT, but to send FIAT its not clear why its required, its just adding friction and decreasing liquidity.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[What happens to my deposit if nobody takes my offer to buy? How long does an order stay in the system before it expires? 
Good until cancel? but if cancel I lose my deposit.
Day order? does it expire at the end of the day if there are no takers?]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Great work!!
wondering what sort of time delays are involved in a TOR network. 
Does any latency attract traders taking advantage of time delays?

Is there some information on ideal system setup. Id think that since this pc was going to have private keys on it..Wed want to make sure we had done all we could to make sure it was secure. Sugetseted setup.. pc running now other apps. linux possibly. behind a nat/firewall , in a process, only use gui for setup and monitor activity of trades with seperate client with no access to private keys??no other hardware attached to minimise risk of bots/malware on pc/// that kinda stuff???

Lastly, will Bots or at least some form of automation (stop loss ect??) be in use at some stage.. Cant imagine Id want to sit at computer all day waiting for a time to trade  :) 

Again.. So appreciative you people are doing this..
Wish I had skills and time to contribute..

        <description><![CDATA[Hi, great to have you around. 

You can&#039;t get your very first bitcoins with Bitsquare. You would need to pay (a low amount of) fees plus you need a security deposit (which you get back after a trade).

For the first coins I&#039;d recommend to ask a friend or family. That would be the easiest approach. 
A second idea would be to buy a small amount from localbitcoins.]]></description>
