<h2>Core Functions</h2>
<p><a name="1"></a><strong>Is Bisq safe and Open Source?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Bisq is open source and licensed under Version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. Here&#8217;s the <a href="https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/" target="_blank">source code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">license</a>.</p>
<p>And yes, Bisq is safe. There are several reasons for this. First, using Bisq doesn&#8217;t require you to submit personally identifying information, so no data about you can get hacked. Next, Bisq employs three technical mechanisms of protection:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. All bitcoins traded with Bisq are secured in a 2-of-3 <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/11108/multisig-future-bitcoin/" target="_blank">multisignature</a> address.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Both traders are required to pay security deposits. These are refunded to them after a trade completes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Bisq features a decentralized and open arbitrator system, to be used in case a trade dispute arises.</p>
<p>We believe these features make currency trading as secure as possible. This said, use Bisq at your own risk.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a><strong>There are already other decentralized exchanges. How is Bisq different?</strong></p>
<p>Currently no other project fits our definition of a decentralized Bitcoin exchange. (<a href="https://openbazaar.org/" target="_blank">Open Bazaar</a> and <a href="https://voluntary.net/bitmarkets/" target="_blank">BitMarkets</a> stand alone in mirroring Bisq&#8217;s principles, but they&#8217;re full market places, not specialized currency exchanges.)</p>
<p>To be properly decentralized, one must avoid single points of failure:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Bisq does not hold any bitcoins. All are held in multisignature addresses rather than a Bisq-controlled wallet.</li>
<li>Bisq does not hold any national currency. National currency is transferred directly from one trader to the other.</li>
<li>Bisq uses a Peer-to-Peer network over Tor. This means there are no servers to be hacked or DDoS&#8217;d.</li>
<li>Bisq does not know the traders. No data is stored on who trades with whom.</li>
<li>Bisq does not require registration. This means privacy is maintained, there are no “approval” wait times, and identity theft becomes impossible.</li>
<li>Bisq does not operate its arbitration system – traders themselves choose from an open and decentralized market of arbitrators.</li>
<li>Bisq is not a company. It is an open source project aiming to organize as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (<a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/" target="_blank">DAO</a>).</li>
<li>Bisq is self-funded by the efforts of its volunteers and contributions of donors.</li>

<p><a name="add_altcoin"></a><strong>How can I get support for my favorite altcoin?</strong></p>
<p>Please read about the requirements and process at our <a href="https://forum.bitsquare.io/t/how-to-add-your-favorite-altcoin" target="_blank">Forum</a>.</p>
<h2>Trading Details</h2>
<p><a name="3"></a><strong>When will I be able to buy or sell real bitcoins?</strong></p>
<p>The mainnet-enabled beta version is live.</p>
<p>There will initially be a one-bitcoin trade limit for all Bisq users. This limit may be relaxed in the future.</p>
<p><a name="4"></a><strong>How does Bisq protect my privacy?</strong></p>
<p>Only your trading partner (and your selected arbitrator in case of a dispute) can ever see your payment information details. The data exchanged between users is encrypted and signed. Bisq uses a P2P network built on top of Tors hidden services and provide the high level of anonymity Tor offers. The user doesn&#8217;t need to setup anything &#8211; all is integrated in the application.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a><strong>How long does a trade take?</strong></p>
<p>Your trade duration will be determined by the transfer times of the currencies you and your trade partner use. National currency transfers can be instant (OkPay) or can take days (SEPA). Bitcoin transactions can take up to 10 minutes, as at least one confirmation from the Bitcoin network is required for a trade to complete.</p>
<p><a name="6"></a><strong>How much does it cost to trade on Bisq?</strong></p>
<p>
                
                Trading fees are based on trade amount and distance to market price. Min. fee (MF) = 0.0002 BTC, default fee (DF) = 0.002 BTC, amount factor (AF) = 1/BTC, market price factor (MF) = square root of percent value (e.g. 1% -> 1, 9% 0 -> 3, 0.01% -> 0.1). Tradeing fee = max(MF, DF * amount * AF * MF). E.g. 0.002 BTC for 1 BTC trade at 1% market price distance.
                
                </p>
<p><a name="openOffer"></a><strong>Why do I need to keep my application online when I have an open offer?</strong></p>
<p>If you have published an offer your Bisq application need to stay online so it is able to react in the case when another trader wants to take your offer. The MultiSig depost transaction is created in that take-offer process. Be sure you have deactivated your computers standby mode, otherwise your Bisq application lose the internet connection (monitor standby is not a problem). If you shut down the application your offer gets removed from the distributed offerbook as it would become unavailable for others. After starting Bisq again your offer gets re-published.</p>
<p><a name="editOffer"></a><strong>How can I edit my offer?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment you cannot edit an offer once it is published. But you can use the percentage based price so your price will stick with the market price (we use BitcoinAverage for fiat and Poloniex for altcoins). E.g. If you set your percentage price to 1% below the market price for a buy offer, the price will update with every market price update (about 90 sec.) and when a trader takes your offer the actual marketprice minus 1% will be used.</p>
<p><a name="7"></a><strong>Will my bank know I&#8217;m buying bitcoins?</strong></p>
<p>There have been reports that some banks have closed client accounts when they see that there is Bitcoin activity involved.</p>
<p>The reference text of the bank transfer used to trade with Bisq will include only the Bisq trade ID (which is a random sequence of characters, like many other purchase IDs). Any trader that is not using the exact ID number as reference text of a bank transfer is considered in breach of contract, which will result in dispute resolution.</p>
<p>To avoid problems we recommend setting up a dedicated bank account for buying and selling bitcoins. If the bank were to block this account, it would cause fewer problems for you than if the bank were to block your primary account.</p>
<p>Never mention anything else than the trade reference in the subject field.</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p><a name="8"></a><strong>What is an arbitrator?</strong></p>
<p>An arbitrator is a real person who finds solutions to any disputes that may occur during a trade. <a href="/arbitration_system.pdf" target="_blank">Bisq&#8217;s arbitrators</a> must pay high security deposits, which ensure fair evaluations and prevent collusion with traders.</p>
<p>Initially, traders make a list of arbitrators they approve. When a new trade is initiated, an arbitrator is randomly selected from among the traders&#8217; overlapping, approved selections. The more arbitrators a trader accepts, the more trades will be available to him.</p>
<p>Note: At this time, a fully decentralized arbitration system is not yet developed. The current bootstrapping phase instead uses a closed group of trusted arbitrators. This will change as soon the fully decentralized system is implemented.</p>
<p><a name="9"></a><strong>How does the arbitration process work?</strong></p>
<p>If Trader A fails to confirm the receipt of a national currency transfer within the allotted time (e.g. six days for SEPA, one day for OKPay, etc.), a button to contact the arbitrator will appear to both traders. Trader B will then be able to submit evidence to the arbitrator that he did, in fact, send the national currency. Alternatively, if Trader B never sent the national currency, Trader A will be able to submit evidence to the arbitrator that the funds were never received. Submitted evidence should be cryptographically secure using either <a href="https://tlsnotary.org/" target="_blank">PageSigner</a> or digitally-signed bank statements. If these methods fail, more traditional routes of discovery can be deployed.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will side with buyer or seller and sign the 2-of-3 multisignature address in favor of the appropriate party.</p>
<p><a name="10"></a><strong>How is collusion between arbitrators and traders prevented?</strong></p>
<p>As outlined above, arbitrators must pay a high security deposit to become such – higher than the one-bitcoin trade limit. If an arbitrator&#8217;s dispute resolution is not agreed to by both traders, a second round of arbitration can be requested by either of them.</p>
<p>The Bisq system in this case will then select an arbitrator from among the highest-rated arbitrators. If collusion is found to have taken place, the misbehaving arbitrator will lose her deposit. This puts the arbitrator at a significant loss, as her security deposit was more than she made by being dishonest.</p>
<p><a name="11"></a><strong>What happens if the person buying bitcoin does a chargeback on their national currency after the bitcoin has been released from the multisig escrow?</strong></p>
<p>We only support payment methods in which chargebacks are not easy (i.e. we don&#8217;t support Paypal). But there is still certain chargeback risk with banks. If a bank executes a chargeback after the cryptocurrency escrow has released, there is nothing the arbitrator can do.</p>
<p>Bisq&#8217;s goal is to make this scenario as unattractive as possible, using <a href="/risk_analysis.pdf" target="_blank">three primary mechanisms</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. There is a trade limit of one bitcoin, which is generally too small to attract criminals (though this limit may be lifted in the future).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. We will remove national currency payment methods which are found to be used for chargebacks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Bisq has support for delayed payouts using the “locktime” feature, which might help if the chargeback is done quickly after the transfer.</p>
<p><a name="12"></a><strong>Wouldn&#8217;t a pure reputation system among traders make arbitrators unnecessary?</strong></p>
<p>Pure reputation without the option of arbitration is a weak protection system, as you can never avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack" target="_blank">sybil</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick" target="_blank">long con</a> attacks.</p>
<p><a name="13"></a><strong>Can I be an arbitrator?</strong></p>
<p>Once the open and decentralized arbitration process is developed anyone can become an arbitrator. At the current state it not closed to trusted developers.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><a name="14"></a><strong> If I don’t have any bitcoins, how can I obtain enough to pay the security deposit on my first trade?</strong></p>
<p>We recognize that the 0.01 BTC security deposit could be a barrier to entry to bitcoin beginners, but Bisq&#8217;s targeted users have used cryptocurrencies before.</p>
<p>The security deposit is needed to protect Bisq from fraud and abuse. That said, we will always investigate possible solutions which would allow new users to trade without needing bitcoin first.</p>
<p>Bitcoin can be purchased via many channels: friends or family, Bitcoin meetups, Bitcoin ATMs, LocalBitcoins, Mycelium LocalTrader, or from any of the centralized exchanges.</p>
<p><a name="15"></a><strong>Does Bisq support ‘XYZ’ payments?</strong></p>
<p>Bisq will support a wide range of payment methods for national currencies. The criteria for inclusion are that the payment method is safe against chargebacks, and that it allows the arbitrator to view evidence of the transaction (preferably in a way which doesn&#8217;t display the trader&#8217;s personally identifying information).</p>
<p>We need help from users in different regions to collect data on various payment methods. Contribute your knowledge to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQHhtAOieu5i6_2rvkvtcLS70A991aZlxkJgzv97XuU" target="_blank">document</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xiOqcBSInIF7ozWdN3DvM5O-nyZ-397G9MR8LOXs6iA/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> to help Bisq incorporate more payment methods</p>
<p><a name="17"></a><strong>What happens in case of software bugs?</strong></p>
<p>If the Bisq application recognizes that you&#8217;re having a software problem, it will display a “support ticket” button. Your arbitrator will forward your bug report to the developers, who will begin an investigation of the problem. You may be asked for the <a href="https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/wiki/Guilde-for-testing-Bisq#bug-reports">log file</a> to assist the process.</p>
<p>If the button does not appear, wait for your trade period to expire. Then submit a standard dispute to your arbitrator, explaining the software problem. No arbitration fees will be charged in the resolution of problems caused by software bugs.</p>
<p><a name="18"></a><strong>What is a Bitcoin &#8216;multisignature address&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p>“<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/11108/multisig-future-bitcoin/" target="_blank">Multisig</a>,” as it&#8217;s called, is built into Bitcoin as a simple version of a smart contract. A multisig address is generated with multiple public keys and a specification of how many of those keys must sign to release the funds.</p>
<p>Bisq uses 2-of-3 multisig addresses. This means three public keys are used to create the payment address (the buyer&#8217;s, seller&#8217;s, and arbitrator&#8217;s), and the transaction must be signed by two parties for the funds to be released. A typical trade takes place when the buyer and seller sign the transaction to release the funds to the appropriate party. But in case of a dispute, the arbitrator will side with either the buyer or seller, and these two parties&#8217; keys will release the funds to the appropriate party.</p>

I currently run <a href="https://coinduit.io/" rel="nofollow">https://coinduit.io</a> which sells bitcoins to UK customers so I&#8217;m very interested in something like this. I think you guys are on exactly the right track.</p>
<p>1) &#8220;We store the encrypted bank account details in the blockchain with the registration&#8221; &#8211; what if the bank details change slightly but still work i.e. slight name change, or are you only using account number and sort codes that are unique to the account?</p>
<p>2) If it&#8217;s decentralised who decides which payment options are valid? Does each seller always need to attach themselves to an arbitrator who will decide these things?</p>
<p>3) How do you handle collusion? i.e. sellers who select arbitrator that they know.</p>
<p>4) What about a reputation system initiated using proof of burn as OpenBazaar are planning? Wouldn&#8217;t this make it possible to trade solely on reputation, without the need for an arbitrator and thus be more efficient fee wise? (0 fee essentially).</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Sorry for the late reply. Here are my answers&#8230;</p>
<p>1: We will use the mandatory and identifying fields of the payment account (will be very different depending on bank, payment processor, mobile payment solutions&#8230;). You can also create multiple payment accounts. All require a separate registration, but the fee very low and the registration process is painless. Its only purpose is to protect against sock puppets and we use the payment account as a scarce resource to archieve that. The registration data are only visible to the trading peer in case of a trade (due the bank tx they are disclosed anyway to the trading partner).</p>
<p>2: The developers need to add new payment methods if requested. We want to support all which are known to be hard to charge back and from which we have enough information (mandatory fields, fees, reputation, tx duration&#8230;). If a user wants to get a new payment method added he can simply provide enough info to the team and if it fulfills our requirements we will add it. The payment method is displayed next to the offer, so the taker can decide if he can or want to take the deal with that payment method.</p>
<p>3: Both traders select a set of accepted arbitrators. You can only trade with otheres if at least 1 arbitrator is matching from boths sets (the more arbitrators you accept the more trades are available for you). Collusion is protected due a high security deposit of the arbitrators and a second arbitration round if one of the traders request that. If in that second round (arbitrator is selected by the system among the highest rated arbitrators) collusion is detected, the misbehaving arbitrator will lose his deposit and lose much more money as he can earn from cheating (trade volume is limited, security deposit is &gt; 2x max. trade volume). </p>
<p>4: Reputation is a weak protection as you can never avoid sybil and long con attacks, so we don&#8217;t use it, but a voluntarily higher security deposit (and maybe also registration fee) payment might be used as possibility to increase ones reputation. But it would not be enough to replace an arbitration system (also Open Bazaar use arbitration).<br />
For a marketplace like Open Bazaar reputation system is more important as the outcome of a deal is not binary like in a currency exchange.</p>
<p>Hope I could answer your questions. Feel free to check out our whitepaper for more details.</p>

I have to send bitcoin to fund an order. Thats ok. But its rather funny that there is an additional minimum network fee requirement to satisfy within this transaction to get my order listed. If not no order listed. Here is the point, some wallets don&#8217;t even offer the option to change the network fee for sending funds. If you require that for outgoing transfers fine. but for incoming it limits the user base?!</p>

The problem is if the funding tx has a too low fee and does not get into the block chain the following trade tx (based on that funding tx) also don&#8217;t get confirmed, so delaying the trade process and in worst case exceeding the max. allowed trade period. In some bad days there is  backlog of about 1 day with low fees&#8230;<br />
That there are still wallets which have not updated to the situation to make fees adjustable is a bad sign for that wallet. The fee issue is nothing new, its an issue since at least half a year and adjusting the fee to your need for priority is a must have for a modern wallet&#8230;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-57" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thats another great cost saver!<br />
May I offer few more observations.<br />
First, in the market tab one could provide within a fourth column the payment information to the existing orders (grey depending on setup payment method setup). Otherwise one has to go to the buy/sell tab and search for a specific offer within the different payment methods. Further in the buy tab I can select to see &#8216;all&#8217; payment methods while in the sell tab not. Maybe its related to existing orders&#8230;<br />
Second, the &#8216;create offer for buying bitcoin&#8217; seems a literal translation from German. &#8216;Angebot zum kaufen von bitcoin&#8217;. Personally its confusing as &#8216;offer&#8217; in English has a different meaning. &#8216;Bid for bitcoin&#8217; or &#8216;offer bitcoin&#8217; should suffice. Its like &#8216;Geld/Brief&#8217; in German.<br />
Third is regarding bad order book liquidity. Meaning the empty order books. The only way to adjust existing orders is to delete and place new. Orders must be adjustable (manually/electronically via api) or able to be placed in reference to an exchange or index (with a min./max. margin) in order to not &#8216;get picked up&#8217; when supply/demand situation changes. Bisq provides/offers the hassle free and cost effective way to exchange FX for people in demand for btc (e.g. interested individuals) and supply of (e.g. broker/dealer). Both safe cost/time as no additionally regulatory requirement is needed/obeyed!! No ID/bill providing to proof I&#8217;m human and no license conditions for btc dealers/brokers is to be satisfied. What cost savings and rendering bureaucracy once more entirely useless!! This is so awesome/marvelous!! That message needs to be conveyed in bitsquares&#8217; introductory video instead of all the needs bitsquare has. I would like to expand on this but run out of space and maybe you stopped reading already. Anyway, have a good weekend.</p>

&#8211; Will consider to add that 4th column. I wanted to keep the overview very simple, but I understand it would make sense.<br />
&#8211; That the &#8220;show all payment methods&#8221; was not displayed was a bug &#8211; thanks for reporting. Just fixed it for the next release.<br />
&#8211; Re: wording: I will do a review with a native english speaker over all text used in Bisq for an upcoming release. I think there are more issues like that. I had it initially shorter (Buy Bitcoin) but people did not understand it that it was for creating an offer, so I added more info. I personally don&#8217;t like Bid/Ask so much as it is not so well understood by less experienced traders.<br />
&#8211; It is planned for a upcoming version to add a percentage price based on Bitcoin average price feed. To change offers will be considered as well.<br />
&#8211; Re: Transmitting benefits of Bisq/promotion: I would love to talk more about that with you. Can you get in touch with me by email (manfred [at] bitsquare [dot] io?</p>

The only differences you would need to do is take out the ability to edit the protocol by miners (meaning &#8220;you want to mine for us, you use our software&#8221; kind of network), and the reward would have to be dispersed to all participants proportional to their contribution (as opposed to a single miner being rewarded at the end of the block). Also you&#8217;re trying to maintain anonymity, so blocks could be pruned every 5 days thus ending the need to worry about block-sizes, hard-drive space&#8230;etc hardware burden. This also eliminates some motivations for collusion, as participation as a node would be incentive enough not to bother cheating. You could also do away with the barrier of having to put up Bitcoin just to buy more Bitcoin. A participant could mine for the network until they&#8217;d accrued enough SATs to cover their trade fees, and then transition funds from fiat to Bitcoin without having to bring other Bitcoin out of savings just to do it. </p>
<p>All of this is probably covered in your arbitrator details, but I figured I&#8217;d get it out of my system on the just in case it is not 😉 .</p>

I want to buy some Bitcoin, I accepted an offer and I SEPA transferred the Euro&#8217;s. The SEPA-tx might take a full day. I can now safely shut the BSQ-app and my computer. Tomorrow the BTC-seller might see Euro&#8217;s in his/her bank and confirm this in his/her BSQ-app. But the BTC is not released to me until I open the app. Which might be on day 3. Is this correct?</p>

When I read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackcoin/comments/26biks/should_bithaloblackhalo_be_open_source/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/blackcoin/comments/26biks/should_bithaloblackhalo_be_open_source/</a> I find he originally wanted to make it open source but somehow Reddit users made him change his mind.</p>
<p>When I read the article at <a href="http://bravenewcoin.com/news/bithalo-offers-unbreakable-blockchain-smart-contracts/" rel="nofollow">http://bravenewcoin.com/news/bithalo-offers-unbreakable-blockchain-smart-contracts/</a> I see this very perplexing statement:</p>
<p>When asked if Halo was open source, Zimbeck said it’s not on Github, but the platform is built on top of BitMessege. “If someone asks to see it, I will likely send it to them, though I would change the name of variables, which is regarded as a form of obfuscation. Nevertheless, someone that knows what they are doing will be able to audit the code”</p>
<p>This&#8230; cannot be trusted. Right on its face. You don&#8217;t need to dig more into this to realize it does not follow best security practice for something you&#8217;re trusting your money with. At all.</p>
<p>As to decentralization, it is enough to read <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-decentralized-bitcoin-market-is-for-legal-stuff-only" rel="nofollow">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-decentralized-bitcoin-market-is-for-legal-stuff-only</a> to realize that his idea of &#8220;decentralized&#8221; has been that he alone would hold a &#8220;moderation key&#8221; to censor certain transactions out.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about others, but as for me, this is most definitely crossed out of my list.</p>

<p>So yeah, not sure what the big deal is. He will put it on github when he is ready. With all the pump and dump, do you really blame him? Halo has been around for 3 years man, not a single hack. And you can audit his code and build it so yeah.</p>
<p>Also, the moderation key makes sense. Do you really want him to go to jail like Ross Ulbright?! Come on dude use your head. If you don&#8217;t want the mod key fork it and put your own ass on the line.</p>
<p>Besides, his mod key is only for what he sees. He cant remove some market he doesnt know about and offers can be sent privately. The private offers don&#8217;t even go to the market so obviously he cant censor those. And honestly from talking to him I&#8217;m pretty sure the only thing he would remove is really screwed up evil contracts posted blatantly on the main market. So you are just fudding senselessly. Talk to David, I&#8217;m sure he would be happy to answer your questions. Hes a very nice and honorable person from every convo ive had with him. The dude codes nonstop like a damn saint.</p>

It&#8217;s peer-to-peer, and if all you&#8217;re doing is writing and distributing the program, you aren&#8217;t liable unless the program itself is malicious, such as a virus. Claiming otherwise has no legal grounds. If anything, he&#8217;d be trying to protect the program&#8217;s &#8220;reputation&#8221;, which could easily be construed as censorship.</p>
<p>I cannot audit the code if it&#8217;s obfuscated, like he himself claimed it is on Reddit (see above). He says an expert could audit it, but that&#8217;s nonsense, as the point of obfuscating code is to make it very hard to understand it. That hinders auditing. It&#8217;s obvious.</p>
<p>Your suggestion to just fork the code to remove the moderation key also makes absolutely no sense. Again, THE CODE IS NOT RELEASED AS OPEN SOURCE. The fact there&#8217;s a link to the source hidden somewhere doesn&#8217;t mean I can legally fork the code, if it&#8217;s not released under a suitable open source license (which it is not, as no license is mentioned or included).</p>
<p>It would be illegal for me or you to make a fork.</p>
<p>Yes, maybe I should indeed ask him about these issues, because you don&#8217;t seem to know about them&#8230; which is fine, you don&#8217;t really have to know; but since you don&#8217;t, I feel your level of rudeness (especially towards Manfred, but things like &#8220;use your head&#8221; or &#8220;put your own ass on the line&#8221; aren&#8217;t gems, either) has been excessive for someone who&#8217;s seemingly relatively clueless.</p>

Haven&#8217;t you heard of the patriot act?), we dont live in a fair world. But yeah, he probably just wants the markets clean so the image is clean. You are right, I think changing the moderation key would be a violation of the license but im not sure what license he has on it. However, if you speak of being &#8220;rude&#8221; then perhaps notice your previous comment in caps claiming David can&#8217;t be trusted which is in my opinion extremely rude and not true.</p>
<p>As for auditing, what would you look for in his code? Just look for any external addresses, calls to external servers, its pretty easy to audit honestly. And I&#8217;m sure if you ask him questions he will answer them. He would probably show you the original source lol.</p>
<p>Besides, look at the &#8220;DAO&#8221; where Ethereum deliberately allowed their own code to get hacked by a bug they audited and knew existed before the hack and they even published an article on it. So I&#8217;m not sure it matters, besides people usually download binaries. He said he will open source it. Why don&#8217;t you just ask him instead of arguing with me?</p>
<p>All I did was point out the 2 of 3 arbiter collusion that David has talked about excessively on slack, bitcointalk and reddit over the years. BitSquare should use 2 of 2 instead of putting customer funds at risk with a relatively easy attack. Its not fudding, its a fact. I wasn&#8217;t writing to promote or detract from anyone elses project, I was writing to point out a known flaw and the odd omission of previous smart contracting software. Arbiters are middle men, and decentralization is about removing the middle men.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;endeavor&#8221;, I said &#8221; program, and I said that explicitly in contrast with hosting content on websites (Napster also.ran its own servers, the file transfers were P2P but the system wasn&#8217;t distributed, so the server owners could be held responsible for what was exchanged through the servers, just like with websites, but UNLIKE distributed systems where the original author isn&#8217;t running anything).</p>
<p>In yet other words: you can go to jail for running a server where illegal stuff is exchanged or discussed.<br />
You cannot go to jail for writing a program that contains no illegal part itself, and then not even necessarily running the program, but only distributing it for others to run.</p>
<p>I thought I had already clarified this key difference in my previous post, but I guess your deliberate use of the all or compassing word &#8220;endeavor&#8221; shows I had not been clear.</p>

Anyways yeah I realize that Napster ran its own servers.But my point is, that people go to jail for collecting rainwater and other nonsense things. The guy from reddit killed himself for a nonsense charge. Even though there isn&#8217;t a law today governing open source developers doesn&#8217;t mean that a person will not be made a martyr. So I think a moderation key is fine. Wouldn&#8217;t you make a moderation key if you were the dev?! He isn&#8217;t anonymous unlike most of the other devs.</p>

<p>Btw. have you seen the video button, the big one the left. By clicking on that, you can find tons of explainer videos -explaining nearly every aspect of the project. Also there is a whitepaper, that is for people who take a few minutes more time and are able to read and not only watch videos. ELI5 stuff is also all over the place. So not sure which kind of content you would need, but beyond ELI5 we cannot go, I am sorry. We are aware that we cannot serve all kind of people, and seems you are one of those who we cannot, and to be honest even don&#8217;t want to serve.</p>

But the fee is way higher than for example trading with Kraken. If i understood it right you got a 0.001 BTC (0.60€) for a trade of max. 0.1 BTC (60€) Taht means a fee of 1%.<br />
Thats quiet expensive. At Kraken i pay 0.25% Taker fee and 0.09€ for a SEPA withdrawl. Deposit is free. That means if i trade 0.1 BTC i only pay 0.24€ instead of 0.60€. Why should i trade at bitsquare? If i not just want to wash money 🙂</p>

The BTC are locked up on a 2of3 MultiSig and the Fiat is transferred direct to the BTC seller.</p>

<p>It seems you updated the software in the process. There was a popup that told you about the incresed security deposit, it not just suddenly jumped.<br />
There are no restrictions in the Bisq wallet. You can simply send the money out.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t get your very first bitcoins with Bisq. You would need to pay (a low amount of) fees plus you need a security deposit (which you get back after a trade).</p>
<p>For the first coins I&#8217;d recommend to ask a friend or family. That would be the easiest approach.<br />
A second idea would be to buy a small amount from localbitcoins.</p>

wondering what sort of time delays are involved in a TOR network.<br />
Does any latency attract traders taking advantage of time delays?</p>
<p>Is there some information on ideal system setup. Id think that since this pc was going to have private keys on it..Wed want to make sure we had done all we could to make sure it was secure. Sugetseted setup.. pc running now other apps. linux possibly. behind a nat/firewall , in a process, only use gui for setup and monitor activity of trades with seperate client with no access to private keys??no other hardware attached to minimise risk of bots/malware on pc/// that kinda stuff???</p>
<p>Lastly, will Bots or at least some form of automation (stop loss ect??) be in use at some stage.. Cant imagine Id want to sit at computer all day waiting for a time to trade  🙂 </p>
<p>Again.. So appreciative you people are doing this..<br />
Wish I had skills and time to contribute..<br />
