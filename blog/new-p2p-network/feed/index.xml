		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sergi,
thanks for the links!
I know Bitmarkets and I am in contact with the devs and discussed their solution. In fact I used the same concept initially for Bitsquare but move to the current concept because a 2of2 MultiSig-only solution carries some risks regarding blackmail attacks. But anyway a great project!

Good to hear that CLTV is finally getting in! Great to see that Aaron van Wirdum is covering it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Manfred, insteresting article, as always!

 Was reading an excellent article about Bitmarket (similar to openbazaar) and they discuss advantatges and disadvantatges of both escrow / reputation / security deposit; very professional approach, worth a read, its an easy to read, short whitepaper: https://voluntary.net/bitmarkets/whitepaper/ 

On the other side I just saw that CheckLockTimeVerify will be implemented in Bitcoin by the start-mid 2016, there&#039;s an excellent article explaining exactly what does it means this implementation, and it looks like it offers great possibilites https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/checklocktimeverify-or-how-a-time-lock-patch-will-boost-bitcoin-s-potential-1446658530

keep the good work
regards,
