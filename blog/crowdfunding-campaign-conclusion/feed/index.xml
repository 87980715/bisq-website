		<description><![CDATA[Like beatljuice, I didn&#039;t pledge because the minimum was too high. 

Even at the currently low prices, your minimum was around US$ 50.  I&#039;d throw in $10 or maybe 20, but not 50, sorry. Especially after I realized this campaign is not to complete the project, but just a tiny mile... no, yardstone and I&#039;d have been asked for more money many more times.

I understand there are technical difficulties, but as as an end user, frankly, I don&#039;t care. Find a solution. Smaller campaigns. Different platform. Nested sub-pledges to fill some of those 684 main slots - whatever. Just figure it out and I&#039;ll be in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Its a technical limitation dictated by the bitcoin protocols max. transaction size, so max. 684 pledges are possibile in a campaign. The min. plexdge size is determined by the funding goal. With smaller targets the min. size is also quite small.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the minimum donation issue is a big one. I didn&#039;t donate because of it, and I&#039;m in the US and make more money than most of the rest of the people on earth. Seems to me like only rich westerners can decide what gets developed. This is almost a deal breaker to me. If I don&#039;t find out there is a fix coming I&#039;ll probably uninstall Lighthouse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was an unfortunate outcome. I think more time and some PR would have made the trick, but reality must always be considered. I recommend that we who pledged on Lighthouse send the revoked BTC to the project without using Lighthouse: /contribute/
In the best of worlds 120 BTC may come in that way, given a week or two. Lesser amounts will also help. My BTC are now on their way.]]></description>
