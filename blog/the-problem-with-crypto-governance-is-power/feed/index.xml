		<description><![CDATA[mmm...maybe I misunderstood the question, Nxt is used for the asset exchange though I read that it really support crosschain exchange with its api, a real atomic cross-exchange exchange is indeed part of the SN project it&#039;s called atomic dac http://atomicdac.org/. But you should ask on slack, because the tech part is over my head...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For Ethereum I read that they can create an agent to interface it with SN, there is of course interest to add it. Sorry I&#039;m just a user interested in SN, if you have technical 
questions you should ask the devs on slack because probably I can&#039;t help much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems other coins can be added easily if there is request, if I remember correctly the last time I tested the beta client it had bitcoin, dogecoin, bitcoindark, nxt, opal, vericoin and others that I can&#039;t remember. The superNet client is a light one with not blockchain download. There are also specific coin wallets with the SN features added: so for Bitcoin there will be both an Electrum client and a QT client with SN, for Bitcoindark a client with SN, etc... I think any coin can add SN features to its client by using the api provided. 
Using a specific coin (Nxt) for a specific feature seems inavoidable, this is exactly the point of leveraging the best features. You should think more that all coins gain from each other and the whole is a lot more than a zero-sum game]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does Supernet support completely different coins like Ethereum, Namecoin,....? If so how much effort is it to add it, or what is needed to add it? (not talking about IOU assets)

I also think that using a coin (Nxt) as base for such an exchange/wallet introduce the dominating coin which I want to avoid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In this article you seem to have described many of SuperNet features and it would be very welcome addition to have Bitsquare among the services integrated. Why don&#039;t you join the community? We&#039;re more than 1000 now: http://www.sprnt.slack.com/
From the end-user perspective you have a multicoin client that offers a fast decentralized coins/assets exchange and a lot of other services build on top of it. It leverages the best features of some core coins (mainly Bitcoindark for privacy and Nxt for exchange, plus others) but it all operates under the hood. For those who don&#039;t like the volatility of crypto there is also a new system of completely decentralized and blockchain-enforced pegged currencies. 
So you can use Bitcoin but enjoy features not otherwise available and allocate the risk as you wish among other coins, assets that pay dividends or pegged currencies. Privacy is strong, even in the unfortunate case that Bitcoin comes under greater power control that would be no help to them. 
It will not take long for the first release. People can read more about superNet in the links below:
